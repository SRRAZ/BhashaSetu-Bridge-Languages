MOCK PROGUARD MAPPING FILE - This is a placeholder for the actual ProGuard mapping file that would be generated during the build process.

File name: free-mapping.txt
Version: 1.1.0
Build Type: Release
Flavor: Free

This mapping file contains the relationship between the original and obfuscated class names, methods, and fields for the free version of the English-Hindi Learning app. It should be preserved for crash deobfuscation.

# Example mapping content (abbreviated):
com.bhashasetu.app.MainActivity_ViewBased -> a.a.a:
    void onCreate(android.os.Bundle) -> a
com.bhashasetu.app.data.model.Word -> a.a.b.a:
    java.lang.String word -> a
    java.lang.String translation -> b
com.bhashasetu.app.audio.AudioPlayer -> a.a.c.a:
    void playAudio(java.lang.String) -> a
    void stopAudio() -> b

# Full mapping file would contain mappings for all classes, methods, and fields in the app
# The actual file is much longer (typically thousands of lines)
