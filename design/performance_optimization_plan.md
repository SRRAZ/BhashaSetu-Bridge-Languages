# Performance Optimization Plan

## Integration Goals
- Ensure all enhanced components work together seamlessly
- Validate data flow between cache, network, and UI layers
- Implement consistent error handling across components
- Establish proper lifecycle management for all components

## Performance Optimization Areas

### 1. Memory Management
- Implement memory-efficient bitmap loading and caching
- Optimize collection usage (SparseArray instead of HashMap where appropriate)
- Avoid memory leaks in lifecycle-aware components
- Use WeakReferences for context references in long-lived objects

### 2. UI Rendering Performance
- Flatten view hierarchies where possible
- Implement view recycling for lists and grids
- Use ViewHolder pattern consistently in all adapters
- Optimize custom view implementations with hardware acceleration

### 3. Battery Consumption
- Batch network requests to reduce radio usage
- Defer background tasks when battery is low
- Use JobScheduler for background operations with appropriate constraints
- Optimize location updates and sensor usage

### 4. App Startup Performance
- Implement lazy initialization of non-critical components
- Use App Startup library for dependency initialization
- Apply startup tracing to identify bottlenecks
- Consider using WorkManager for post-startup initialization

### 5. Background Processing
- Consolidate background operations using WorkManager
- Implement proper backoff strategies for failed operations
- Use batching for database operations
- Apply proper threading strategies with AppExecutors

### 6. Resource Loading
- Implement progressive image loading
- Use proper image formats (WebP instead of PNG where applicable)
- Optimize resource qualifiers for different screen densities
- Implement resource compression

### 7. Network Optimization
- Implement proper HTTP caching
- Use compression for network requests
- Optimize payload size
- Implement efficient serialization/deserialization

### 8. Database Optimization
- Use indexes for frequently queried columns
- Batch database operations
- Optimize query patterns
- Implement efficient content providers
