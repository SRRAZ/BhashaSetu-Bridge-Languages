5. Regression test after fixes are implemented

## Reporting

For each edge case test, document:
- Test scenario and steps
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Environment details (device, OS version, etc.)
- Severity and impact assessment
- Screenshots or recordings of issues
- Recommendations for fixing issues

## Conclusion

This edge case test plan is designed to uncover issues that might not be found during regular functional testing. By systematically testing these boundary conditions, we can ensure the English-Hindi Learning App is robust and reliable under all circumstances.
