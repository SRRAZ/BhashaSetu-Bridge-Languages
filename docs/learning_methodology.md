# Learning Methodology for English-Hindi Learning App

## Overview

The English-Hindi Learning App implements evidence-based language acquisition methodologies optimized for Hindi speakers learning English. This document outlines the educational approach, learning strategies, and pedagogical principles that form the foundation of the application.

## Core Educational Principles

### 1. Bilingual Learning Approach

The app employs a bilingual approach that leverages the learner's native Hindi language knowledge to facilitate English acquisition. Rather than immersion-only methods, we recognize the value of contextual understanding through one's primary language.

**Implementation:**
- All content presented in both English and Hindi
- Clear associations between equivalent concepts
- Translation as a scaffold, not a crutch
- Gradual reduction of Hindi support as proficiency increases

### 2. Spaced Repetition System (SRS)

The app implements an algorithmic review system that schedules content reviews at optimal intervals to maximize long-term retention while minimizing study time.

**Implementation:**
- Adaptive scheduling based on individual performance
- Increasing intervals between successful reviews
- Immediate review for difficult items
- Performance tracking to refine intervals

Memory retention curve with SRS:

Retention %
   │   *           *                 *
   │    \         /                 /
   │     \       /                 /
   │      \     /                 /
   │       \   /                 /
   │        \ /                 /
   │         V                 V
   └───────────────────────────────────→ Time
          Review 1     Review 2    Review 3
```

### 3. Comprehensible Input

Following Krashen's input hypothesis, the app provides language input that is slightly above the learner's current proficiency level (i+1) to foster natural acquisition.

**Implementation:**
- Graded vocabulary and grammatical structures
- Context-rich examples
- Multimodal presentation (text, audio, visual)
- Scaffolded complexity in lessons

### 4. Active Recall

The app emphasizes retrieval practice where learners actively recall information rather than passively reviewing it.

**Implementation:**
- Prompted recall exercises
- Production-focused activities
- Cloze exercises (fill-in-the-blank)
- Retrieval before review

### 5. Contextual Learning

Language is presented in authentic contexts and practical situations rather than isolated vocabulary lists.

**Implementation:**
- Thematic organization of content
- Real-world dialogue examples
