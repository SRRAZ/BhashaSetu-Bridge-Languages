# Implementation Plan for Offline Mode and Content Caching

After analyzing the codebase, I'll enhance the existing offline capabilities by implementing the following improvements:

## 1. Enhance CacheManager
- Implement intelligent prefetching of essential content
- Add cache validation and refresh mechanisms
- Optimize storage management with priority-based eviction
- Add automatic background synchronization

## 2. Improve Data Availability
- Create a local database cache for API responses
- Implement Repository pattern with offline-first approach
- Add versioning for data synchronization

## 3. Enhance UI Feedback for Offline Mode
- Create clear visual indicators for offline status
- Add feedback for cached vs uncached content
- Improve user guidance when offline

## 4. Optimize Network Transitions
- Handle network state transitions gracefully
- Queue operations when offline for later execution
- Implement conflict resolution for offline changes

## 5. Component Integration
- Ensure all app components work with offline content
- Create consistent offline experience across activities
- Add proper error handling for offline scenarios

## 6. Performance Optimization
- Minimize memory usage for cached content
- Optimize database queries for offline mode
- Reduce battery consumption during sync operations

Let's implement these improvements to ensure a seamless offline experience.
