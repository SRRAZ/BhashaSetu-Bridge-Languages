# Progress Tracking Design

## Overview

Effective progress tracking is essential for language learning applications, providing users with motivation, clarity on their learning journey, and insights to optimize their study habits. This document outlines the comprehensive progress tracking system for the English-Hindi Learning App, including metrics, visualizations, achievements, and the technical implementation.

## Core Progress Metrics

### Vocabulary Acquisition
- **Words Learned**: Total count of words marked as "known"
- **Learning Stage Tracking**: For each word:
  - New (recently introduced)
  - Learning (in active review)
  - Reviewing (periodic reinforcement)
  - Mastered (high confidence level)
- **Category Coverage**: Percentage of words learned in each category
- **Word Proficiency Score**: 0-100% scale based on correct usage in exercises

### Learning Activities
- **Lessons Completed**: Total and percentage of available lessons
- **Time Spent Learning**: Daily, weekly, monthly tracking
- **Exercise Completion**: Number and types of exercises completed
- **Quiz Performance**: Scores and completion rates
- **Streaks**: Consecutive days of active learning

### Proficiency Metrics

## Spaced Repetition System

### Core Algorithm
- Based on modified SuperMemo SM-2 algorithm
- Factors influencing review scheduling:
  - Past performance with the word
  - Time since last review
  - User difficulty rating
  - Word complexity factor

### Review Scheduling
- **Initial Learning**:
  - First review: same day
  - Second review: next day
  - Third review: 3 days later
  - Subsequent reviews: based on algorithm

- **Review Intervals**:
  - Scale based on correctness and confidence
  - Correct with high confidence: interval * 2.5
  - Correct with medium confidence: interval * 2.0
  - Correct with low confidence: interval * 1.5
  - Incorrect: reset to 1-2 days

- **Priority Queue**:
  - Words due for review ordered by importance
  - Overdue items prioritized
  - Recently failed items emphasized
  - Balance with new word introduction

### Visual Calendar
- **Review Forecast**:
  - Calendar showing upcoming review load
  - Word counts due for review each day
  - Estimated time commitment

- **Review History**:
  - Past performance on each word
  - Interval progression visualization
  - Difficulty trend analysis
