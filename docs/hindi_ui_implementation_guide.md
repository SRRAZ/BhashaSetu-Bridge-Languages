# Hindi UI Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides the framework and standards for implementing Hindi UI elements in the English-Hindi Learning App. The implementation follows best practices for bilingual interfaces and ensures proper display of Devanagari script.

## Core Components

### 1. Language Resources (`strings.xml`)
- Primary English strings in `/res/values/strings.xml`
- Hindi translations in `/res/values-hi/strings.xml`
- Format identifiers used for dynamic content (e.g., `%1$d`, `%s`)
- Common strategy pattern for string naming

### 2. Font Support
- **Primary Hindi Font:** Noto Sans Devanagari
- **Backup Font:** Andada Pro (for better fallback support)
- Font files included in `/res/font/` directory
- XML-based font family definition for style flexibility

### 3. Custom UI Components

#### BilingualTextView
- Displays text in both English and Hindi
- Automatically shows the appropriate language based on user preference
- Supports various text styles (small, medium, large, header, title)
- Easily configurable through XML attributes

#### BilingualButton
- Button with bilingual text support
- Dynamically switches between Hindi and English text
- Proper styling for Hindi text with correct line spacing and font
- Maintains button functionality while providing language flexibility

#### HindiTextView
- Specialized TextView for Hindi text
- Ensures proper display of Devanagari script
- Manages text direction and alignment
- Optimized line spacing for better readability

### 4. Style Resources

Hindi-specific styles in `hindi_styles.xml`:
- Text appearances for various sizes and weights
- Button styling with proper Hindi font support
- EditText styling for Hindi input
- Proper text alignment and direction handling

### 5. Language Management

#### LanguageUtils
- Centralized language management utilities
- Functions for setting and retrieving language preference
- Methods for applying language configuration to activities
- Locale management for appropriate context configuration

#### BaseActivity
- Base class for activities with language support
- Automatically applies language configuration
- Provides helper methods for managing bilingual UI elements
- Handles activity recreation for language changes

#### LanguageSettingsActivity
- Dedicated activity for language selection
- Bilingual interface for language settings
- Simple radio button selection between English and Hindi
- Proper locale application when changing language

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Activity Implementation

For each activity that needs Hindi support:
1. Extend `BaseActivity` instead of `AppCompatActivity`
2. Check for Hindi preference and load appropriate layout
3. Use BilingualTextView and BilingualButton components where possible
4. Apply Hindi text styles to any standard TextView components displaying Hindi text

Example:
```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    
    if (useHindiInterface) {
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_name_hindi);
    } else {
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_name);
    }
    
    // Initialize UI components
    // Apply Hindi styles where necessary
}
```

### 2. Layout Implementation

For each layout file:
1. Create standard English version in main layout directory
2. Create Hindi version with `_hindi` suffix for specialized Hindi layouts
3. Use BilingualTextView and BilingualButton components for dynamic content
4. Apply appropriate styles to all text elements

### 3. String Resource Management

1. Add all user-facing strings to `strings.xml`
2. Provide Hindi translations in `strings-hi.xml`
3. Use format identifiers consistently
4. Maintain parallel structure between English and Hindi strings

### 4. Font Handling

1. Use the provided Noto Sans Devanagari font for all Hindi text
2. Apply appropriate text styles based on content importance
3. Consider line spacing and text size for Hindi text (typically needs more space)
4. Test with various text lengths to ensure proper wrapping and display

## Testing Guidelines

1. Test all screens with both English and Hindi interfaces
2. Verify proper text alignment and direction
3. Check text truncation and wrapping with longer Hindi text
4. Ensure proper font rendering on various screen sizes
5. Test language switching functionality
6. Verify that dynamic content updates correctly when language is changed

## Performance Considerations

1. Layout inflates twice for bilingual components - optimize where possible
2. Consider memory usage with multiple fonts
3. Cache language preference for faster startup
4. Lazy load Hindi resources when using English interface

## Accessibility Considerations

1. Ensure proper content descriptions for all elements in both languages
2. Maintain sufficient contrast ratios for text readability
3. Support system font size adjustments
4. Test with screen readers for both languages

This implementation guide provides a framework for consistent Hindi UI integration throughout the app. Following these guidelines will ensure a smooth bilingual experience for users regardless of their language preference.
