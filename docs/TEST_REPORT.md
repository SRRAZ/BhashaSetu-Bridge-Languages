   - Fix: Implemented more efficient monitoring with longer polling intervals when app is in background
   - Status: ✅ Fixed

## Performance Optimization Recommendations

Based on testing results, the following optimizations are recommended:

1. **Lazy Loading of Resources**
   - Defer loading of heavy resources until they are needed
   - Estimated impact: 15% reduction in startup time

2. **Image Caching Improvements**
   - Implement a more efficient image caching strategy
   - Estimated impact: 30% reduction in memory usage during image-heavy operations

3. **Background Process Batching**
   - Batch background operations to reduce wake cycles
   - Estimated impact: 20% reduction in battery consumption

4. **View Recycling in Lists**
   - Improve view recycling in list adapters
   - Estimated impact: Smoother scrolling and reduced memory allocation
