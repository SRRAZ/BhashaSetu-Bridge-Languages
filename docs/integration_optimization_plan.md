# Integration and Optimization Plan

## 1. Integration Strategies

### 1.1 Component Integration
- Connect the enhanced CacheManager to all relevant activities
- Integrate OfflineStatusView across the application
- Connect repositories with the offline queue system
- Ensure NetworkUtils is properly initialized and utilized

### 1.2 Data Flow Optimization
- Implement centralized data access through repositories
- Ensure consistent error handling across components
- Add proper state management for online/offline transitions
- Create data transformers to reduce object allocation

### 1.3 Dependency Management
- Implement a lightweight dependency injection pattern
- Add lifecycle awareness to network components
- Ensure proper initialization order of components
- Add lazy initialization for heavy components

## 2. Performance Optimization

### 2.1 Memory Optimization
- Implement efficient recycling in all list adapters
- Optimize image loading and caching pipeline
- Reduce object allocation in critical paths
- Implement view holder pattern consistently
- Add bitmap pooling for image-heavy screens

### 2.2 Rendering Performance
- Reduce overdraw through layout optimization
- Optimize layouts using ConstraintLayout
- Flatten view hierarchies where possible
- Implement hardware acceleration appropriately
- Use proper alpha blending and clipping

### 2.3 CPU/Battery Optimization
- Batch database operations
- Implement efficient background threading
- Reduce wake locks and location updates
- Implement batch processing for network operations
- Optimize loops and data structures in critical paths

### 2.4 Storage Optimization
- Implement efficient data compression for cache
- Add data cleanup strategies
- Implement versioning for database schema
- Optimize database indices and queries
- Reduce redundant storage across components

## 3. Testing and Validation

### 3.1 Performance Profiling
- Conduct memory profiling
- Analyze CPU usage with Android Profiler
- Test rendering performance with GPU rendering tool
- Measure app startup time and key user flows
- Profile database operation performance

### 3.2 Optimization Validation
- Benchmark before and after optimization
- Validate on low-end devices
- Test across various Android versions
- Measure impact on battery consumption
- Test with constrained resources (low memory)
