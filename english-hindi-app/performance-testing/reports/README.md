## Report Format

Each report follows a consistent structure:

1. **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of findings and key metrics
2. **Testing Methodology**: Description of how tests were conducted
3. **Results Analysis**: Detailed findings with visualizations
4. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Identified issues affecting performance
5. **Optimization Recommendations**: Specific suggestions for improvement
6. **Conclusion**: Overall assessment and next steps

## Using These Reports

These reports serve multiple purposes:

1. **Release Decisions**: Determine if performance meets release criteria
2. **Optimization Prioritization**: Guide future performance improvement efforts
3. **Hardware Recommendations**: Set minimum and recommended device specifications
4. **Marketing Materials**: Support performance claims in app listings
5. **Development Guidance**: Help developers understand performance implications of design choices

## Report Generation

Reports are generated using a combination of:

1. Test result data from the `results` directory
2. Baseline comparisons from the `baseline` directory
3. Custom analysis scripts
4. Manual expert analysis and recommendations

New reports should be generated:
- Before each major release
- After significant optimization efforts
- When adding major new features
- When updating minimum supported Android version
