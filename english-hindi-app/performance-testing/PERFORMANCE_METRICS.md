# Performance Metrics for English-Hindi Learning App

This document outlines the key performance metrics that will be measured and tracked for the English-Hindi Learning application.

## Core Metrics

### 1. App Startup Time
- **Cold Start**: Time from app launch to first interactive frame when the app is not in memory
- **Warm Start**: Time from app launch to first interactive frame when the app is already in memory
- **Hot Start**: Time to restore the app from the background
- **Target**: Cold start < 2s, Warm start < 1s, Hot start < 500ms

### 2. Memory Usage
- **Base Memory**: Memory usage after app launch (home screen)
- **Peak Memory**: Maximum memory usage during typical user flows
- **Memory Leaks**: Identify and measure any memory leaks
- **Target**: Base memory < 50MB, Peak memory < 150MB, No memory leaks

### 3. Rendering Performance
- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60fps during scrolling and animations
- **Jank Score**: Percentage of frames that took more than 16ms to render
- **UI Thread Utilization**: Percentage of time the UI thread is blocked
- **Target**: 90% of frames at 60fps, Jank score < 5%, UI thread utilization < 70%

### 4. Network Efficiency (if applicable)
- **Payload Size**: Size of data transferred
- **Request Time**: Time to complete network requests
- **Caching Efficiency**: Percentage of requests served from cache
- **Target**: Payload < 50KB per request, Request time < 3s, Cache hit rate > 80%

### 5. Battery Consumption
- **Background Power**: Battery usage when app is in background
- **Active Power**: Battery usage during active app usage
- **Wakelock Usage**: Frequency and duration of wakelocks
- **Target**: Background power < 0.5% per hour, Active power < 5% per hour

### 6. Storage Impact
- **App Size**: APK size and on-device storage footprint
- **Database Growth**: Rate of database size increase with usage
- **Cache Size**: Size of cached data and growth patterns
- **Target**: APK < 20MB, Database growth < 5MB per month, Cache < 30MB

## User-Centric Metrics

### 1. Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Time until the user can meaningfully interact with core features
- **Target**: < 3 seconds for all major features

### 2. Input Latency
- Delay between user input (tap, swipe) and visual response
- **Target**: < 100ms for all interactions

### 3. Animation Smoothness
- Smoothness of transitions and animations
- **Target**: Consistent 60fps for all animations

### 4. Load Time for Content
- Time to load vocabulary lists, quizzes, and learning modules
- **Target**: < 1 second for most content, < 2 seconds for large modules

## Feature-Specific Metrics

### 1. Dictionary/Vocabulary Lookup
- Time to return search results
- **Target**: < 500ms, even for large dictionaries

### 2. Audio Playback
- Delay between tapping pronunciation and audio playback
- **Target**: < 200ms

### 3. Quiz Generation
- Time to generate and display quiz questions
- **Target**: < 1 second

### 4. Progress Calculation
- Time to calculate and display user progress statistics
- **Target**: < 500ms

## Testing Baseline

Performance testing will establish baselines for:
- Debug vs. Release builds
- Free vs. Premium variants
- Different device tiers (low-end, mid-range, high-end)
- Different Android versions (API 21 through 33)

## Improvement Goals

For the release build compared to debug build:
- 30% reduction in app startup time
- 25% reduction in memory usage
- 20% reduction in APK size
- 40% improvement in frame rates during heavy animations
- 50% reduction in UI thread blocking

## Reporting and Analysis

Performance metrics will be collected and analyzed to:
1. Identify performance bottlenecks
2. Prioritize optimization efforts
3. Validate effectiveness of optimization implementations
4. Track performance changes across releases
5. Set performance budgets for future development
