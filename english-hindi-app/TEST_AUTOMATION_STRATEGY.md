   - Medium execution time (<15 minutes)
   - Focus on component interactions
   - QA and developer collaboration
   - Run on every pull request

3. **UI Tests (10% of test cases)**:
   - Longer execution time (<30 minutes)
   - Cover critical user journeys
   - QA responsibility
   - Run nightly and before releases

@Test
public void loadVocabulary_withSuccessfulResponse_updatesLiveData() {
    // Arrange
    List<Word> testWords = TestDataFactory.createWordList(10);
    when(wordRepository.getWords()).thenReturn(Single.just(testWords));
    
    // Act
    viewModel.loadVocabulary();
    
    // Assert
    assertThat(viewModel.getWordsLiveData().getValue())
        .isEqualTo(testWords);
    assertThat(viewModel.getLoadingStateLiveData().getValue())

}
```

### UI Test Example (Activity)

```java
@Test
public void displayWordDetails_whenWordClicked_showsWordDetailScreen() {
    // Arrange
    Word testWord = TestDataFactory.createWord();
    launchActivity(testWord);
    
    // Act
    onView(withId(R.id.word_item))
        .perform(click());
    
    // Assert
    onView(withId(R.id.word_detail_container))
        .check(matches(isDisplayed()));
    onView(withId(R.id.word_text))
        .check(matches(withText(testWord.getText())));
}
```

### Integration Test Example (Repository)

```java
@Test
public void getWords_withNetworkAvailable_returnsWordsFromApi() {
    // Arrange
    List<WordDto> testWordDtos = TestDataFactory.createWordDtoList(10);
    mockWebServer.enqueue(new MockResponse()
        .setResponseCode(200)
        .setBody(new Gson().toJson(testWordDtos)));
    
    // Act
    TestObserver<List<Word>> testObserver = wordRepository.getWords().test();
    
    // Assert
    testObserver.assertComplete();
    testObserver.assertNoErrors();
    testObserver.assertValue(words -> 
        words.size() == 10 && 
        words.get(0).getText().equals(testWordDtos.get(0).getText()));
}
```

## Conclusion

This test automation strategy provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of the English-Hindi Learning App. By following the test pyramid approach and focusing on the right levels of testing, we can achieve high test coverage while maintaining reasonable execution times and maintenance effort.

The strategy emphasizes a phased implementation approach, starting with a solid foundation of unit tests and gradually expanding to integration and UI tests. This approach allows us to deliver value early and continuously improve our test coverage over time.

By investing in test automation, we can increase development velocity, improve quality, and provide a better experience for our users.
